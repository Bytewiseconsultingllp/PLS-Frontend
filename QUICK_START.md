## ⚠️ If You See Errors

### "Unable to connect to backend server"
➡️ **Your backend is not running on port 8000**
- Start your backend server
- Check if it's accessible: `curl http://localhost:8000`

### "HTTP error! status: 404" 
➡️ **Backend endpoint doesn't exist**
- Verify `/api/v1/project-builder` endpoint exists in your backend
- Check backend route configuration

### "Failed to authenticate user"
➡️ **Token issue**
- Check that `/api/v1/auth/verifyEmail` returns a JWT token
- Verify token is in response: `result.data.token`
